This question came about because there has been an drought in our area, which is resolved for now, and I am beginning to stop practicing some water-saving measures, but feel discomfort or guilt at no longer doing them. Example sentence: 
I know the drought is over, but I still have a(n) to put a bucket in the shower, and use that water to flush the toilet. 
" Compulsion " (Merriam-Webster) isn't quite right, because there's no strong desire to do the behavior, and no force compelling me to do so--it's more the feeling that the lack of doing the behavior causes. 
" Addiction " (Merriam-Webster) is also not right, because there's no devotion or surrender to a habit known to be bad, and no physiological component. 
"Urge" is not quite right either. I do have the a strong need or desire to have or do something (Merriam-Webster again), but "urge" misses the sense of guilt that occurs when I do not do the behavior. 
This ELU Stack Exchange post has some good ideas, such as "fixation" and "absorption," but they all involve an aspect of attending to something to the exclusion of other things, which is not the case here.
